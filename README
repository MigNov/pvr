 Portable Virtual Machine Repository utility
 ===========================================

This application has been written to allow using your hard-drives/flash-drives
as the repository of VM images. The application has been written in C programming
language and it's using libvirt, libxml2, gtk-vnc and also the blkid as it
supports many functions, like mounting a new block devices (when running as
root) and checking for the repository file (pvr.xml) in the root directory
the user is being asked for the VM to run using the external script and then
the domain is being created containing all the data on the drive itself. The
chooser dialog should be implemented directly as the part of utility using
GTK libs.

Terminology

is also acceptable.
